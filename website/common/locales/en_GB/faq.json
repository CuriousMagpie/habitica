    "webFaqAnswer7": "At level 10, you can choose to become a Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Healer. (All players start as Warriors by default.) Each Class has different equipment options, different Skills that they can cast after level 11, and different advantages. Warriors can easily damage Bosses, withstand more damage from their tasks, and help make their party tougher. Mages can also easily damage Bosses, as well as level up quickly and restore Mana for their party. Rogues earn the most Gold and find the most item drops, and they can help their party do the same. Finally, Healers can heal themselves and their party members. If you don't want to choose a Class immediately -- for example, if you are still working to buy all the gear of your current class -- you can click \"Opt Out\" and re-enable it later under Settings.",

    "faqQuestion25": "What are the different task types?",
    "webFaqAnswer25": "Habitica uses three different task types to accommodate your needs: Habits, Dailies, and To Do’s.\n\nHabits can be positive or negative and represent something you may want to track multiple times per day, or on an unset schedule. Positive Habits will provide you with rewards, like Gold and Experience (Exp), while Negative Habits will cause you to lose health points (HP).\n\nDailies are repeated tasks you want to complete on a more structured schedule. E.g. Once per day, three times a week, or four times a month. Missing Dailies causes you to lose HP, but the more difficult they are, the better the rewards!\n\nTo Do’s are one-off tasks that provide rewards after you complete them. To Do’s can have a due date, but you won’t lose HP if you miss it.\n\nPick the task type that best fits what you want to achieve!",
